#Container Terminal

**Go to discussion and check second comment**

So you need to create a 2d dynamic array.
At each container, check If is inferior or equal to the last.
If true, add it.

Else no dock can accept the next one, add a dock and add it.

**Out**

Result is the length of array.

Don't forget to reset the array on each line.
